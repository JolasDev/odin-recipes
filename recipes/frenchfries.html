<h2>Description</h2>
<p>After a short brine in a vinegar-water solution, these fries get sprinkled with salt to draw out moisture. <em>Less moisture = crispier fries</em>, and <strong>WE ARE HERE. FOR. THEM!</strong><br>
    We found that frying them in peanut oil yields crispier fries that stay crisp much longer than the fries cooked in vegetable oil. That said, you can totally fry these in canola or vegetable oil, just make sure to eat them fast.<br>
    <i>I'm sure that won't be a problem.</i></p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>4</strong> medium russet potatoes</li>
    <li><strong>1/4 c.</strong> white vinegar</li>
    <li><strong>1 tbsp.</strong> salt, plus more for serving</li>
    <li>Peanut oil, for frying</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Peel potatoes and cut into 1/4" sticks. Place in a medium bowl and add enough cold water to submerge them completely. Add vinegar and stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Allow potatoes to brine in refrigerator 30 minutes, then drain and spread onto a paper-towel lined plate in an even layer. Sprinkle with salt and let sit for 5 minutes.<br>Use a paper towel to dab off salt and any excess moisture that has accumulated on the surface.</li>
    <li>Fill a large dutch oven or a large heavy bottomed pot about 2/3 of the way  full with peanut oil and bring to 325° over medium heat.<br>(If you have a candy thermometer, use it to monitor the temperature of the oil!)</li>
    <li>Carefully add fries to oil and cook for 3 minutes. Drain on a paper towel lined plate and increase oil temperature to 375° and fry 4 minutes more.<br>Transfer to a paper towel lined plate or bowl and sprinkle with salt. Serve hot with ketchup or mayo.</li>
