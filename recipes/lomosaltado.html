<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lomo Saltado is a very popular Peruvian dish with origins in <i>chifa</i> cuisine. Chifa is the culinary mashup developed by Chinese-Peruvian immigrants who applied Cantonese techniques and ingredients to Peruvian foods.<br>
This dish is the epitome of this amazing fusion of culinary worlds. The recipe takes <i>aji amarillo</i> (Peruvian chiles) and <i>papas fritas</i> (french fries) and prepares them in the style of a Cantonese stir fry.<br>
Though typically made using beef, I see this as the perfect way to sub in seitan (or tofu or any vegan protein) to create a <strong>delicious, fully vegan meal!</strong><br>
We love using fresh made fries for this, but if you want to save on time and cleanup, oven fries would work great too.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>2 tbsp.</strong> vegetable oil, plus more if needed</li>
    <li><strong>1 lb.</strong> seitan, cut in strips</li>
    <li><strong>1</strong> medium red onion, sliced</li>
    <li><strong>2</strong> aji amarillo or fresno chiles, seeded and sliced</li>
    <li><strong>2</strong> roma tomatoes, cored and sliced</li>
    <li><strong>3</strong> cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li><strong>1/4 c.</strong> soy sauce</li>
    <li><a href="frenchfries.html" target="_blank">French Fries</a></li>
    <li><strong>2 tbsp.</strong> cilantro, chopped</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a skillet over high heat, heat oil until it just starts to smoke. Add seitan and sear, stirring occasionally, for 4 to 5 minutes, or it begins to caramelize.</li>
    <li>If there is no visible oil in the pan, add about a tablespoon more before adding the red onion and aji amarillo (or fresno chile). Cook, tossing constantly, for 3 minutes, until onions have just started to soften.<br>
        Add tomatoes and cook for an additional 2 to 3 minutes, tossing them with the rest of the ingredients. Make sure the tomatoes have not cooked down fully and still retain a bit of bite. Add garlic, a good pinch<br>
        of kosher salt and a couple cracks of black pepper and let cook for another minute.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium and add soy sauce and vinegar, stirring until seitan and veggies are fully coated with sauce. Let sauce reduce for 1 to 1 Â½ minutes, or until it has thickened slightly.</li>
    <li>Remove skillet from heat and add fries, tossing until they have been fully incorporated. Garnish with cilantro and serve.</li>
