<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Instead of dealing with pizza dough, we use a loaf of French bread to create <b>our pizza!</b><br>The "crust" that forms will be crispy on the outside, while staying nice and soft on the inside. While it's delicious as is, we decided to take things <em>a step further</em>.
<br>We brushed our French loaf with garlic butter here to create a garlic bread-esque crust, adding one of our other favorite Italian restaurant staples into the mix.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1</strong> loaf French bread</li>
    <li><strong>4 tbsp.</strong> melted butter</li>
    <li><strong>2</strong> minced garlic cloves</li>
    <li><strong>1 c.</strong> marinara or pizza sauce</li>
    <li><strong>1 1/2 c.</strong> shredded mozzarella</li>
    <li>Pepperoni slices</li>
    <li><strong>2 tbsp.</strong> freshly grated Parmesan</li>
    <li>Crushed red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>Freshly chopped basil, for topping</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400Â°. Slice bread in half lengthwise. Mix melted butter and garlic together and brush all over cut side of bread. Bake for 10 minutes to lightly toast.</li>
    <li>Spread marinara on top and top with mozzarella, pepperoni slices, parmesan, and red pepper flakes. Bake again until cheese is melty, 10 minutes more.</li>
    <li>Top with basil to serve.</li>
